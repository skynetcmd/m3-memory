"""Backend registry — the single source of truth mapping a backend NAME to its
implementation (backend class + dialect singleton).

Why this exists (DESIGN_PHILOSOPHIES §2, modularity): before this, adding a
backend meant editing an ``if name == "..."`` ladder in ``selector.py`` AND a
``_BY_NAME`` dict literal in ``dialect.py`` — two shared files touched for every
new backend, and a cycle risk because ``dialect.py`` had to import the concrete
dialect singletons to build that dict. The registry inverts the dependency: each
backend module *declares itself* via the :func:`register_backend` decorator at
import time, and the shared modules (``selector.active_backend`` /
``dialect.dialect_for``) READ the registry lazily. Result: a new backend is ONE
self-contained file — ``<name>_backend.py`` with its class, its dialect, and a
``@register_backend("<name>")`` line — and ZERO edits to any shared module.

Fail-loud (§3): registration does NOT widen the allow-list. ``BackendName`` /
``selector._VALID`` remain the authoritative set of *selectable* names; a name
that is registered but not allow-listed still raises when selected, and a name
that is allow-listed but never registered raises a clear "not registered" error
rather than silently falling back to another backend's SQL.

Cycle-break (§2): this module imports NOTHING from the backend modules or from
``memory_core``. The backend modules import THIS (for the decorator); the shared
readers import THIS. The dependency flows one way: backend module -> registry
<- shared reader. Registration happens as a side effect of importing the backend
module, which ``selector.active_backend`` triggers lazily on first use.
